### 6. Investment Terms

**What it measures:** Stage, valuation, and deal structure fit for LVV.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | Pre-seed/Seed, reasonable valuation, LVV check size fits |
| 7-8 | Series A, fair terms, LVV could participate |
| 5-6 | Slightly outside sweet spot but workable |
| 3-4 | High valuation, later stage than ideal |
| 1-2 | Too expensive, wrong stage, poor terms |

**LVV Parameters:**
- Stage: Pre-seed to Series A
- Check size: $500K - $2M initial
- Valuation: Seed <$30M, Series A <$100M preferred

### 7. Platform Potential

**What it measures:** Ability to expand beyond initial indication.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | True platform technology, multiple indications clear |
| 7-8 | Good expansion potential, 2-3 additional indications |
| 5-6 | Some platform elements, one follow-on indication |
| 3-4 | Single indication focus, limited expansion |
| 1-2 | One-shot therapy, no platform |

### 8. Competitive MOAT

**What it measures:** Defensibility against competition.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | Strong IP, proprietary data, first-mover advantage |
| 7-8 | Good IP position, some data moat |
| 5-6 | Reasonable IP, competitive but differentiated |
| 3-4 | Weak differentiation, crowded space |
| 1-2 | No moat, easily replicable |

## Company Tier Calculation

**Weighted Average Formula:**
```
Score = (QoS + LoE + (Geroscience×2) + PoC + Team + Terms + Platform + MOAT) / 9
```

Note: Geroscience is weighted 2x, so denominator is 9 (not 8).

**Tier Thresholds:**

| Tier | Score Range | Action |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Accept** | ≥4.25 | Schedule meeting, prioritize |
| **Maybe** | 3.75-4.25 | Review further, conditional interest |
| **Pass** | <3.75 | Not a fit for current thesis |

## Scoring Best Practices

1. **Be consistent** - Apply same standards across all entities
2. **Document reasoning** - Note why each score was given
3. **Update over time** - Re-evaluate when new info available
4. **Weight appropriately** - Remember Geroscience Fit is 2x for companies
5. **Consider context** - Early-stage companies may lack evidence but have strong teams
