# LVV Investment Thesis Reference

Lifespan Vision Ventures investment criteria and strategy.

---

## Core Thesis

**LVV invests in companies developing therapeutics that target the biology of aging.**

The fund believes that aging is the root cause of most chronic diseases, and that interventions targeting aging biology will be more effective than treating diseases one at a time.

## Investment Parameters

### Stage Focus

| Stage | Interest | Check Size |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Pre-seed | Primary | $250K - $500K |
| Seed | Primary | $500K - $1.5M |
| Series A | Primary | $1M - $2M |
| Series B+ | Selective | Follow-on only |

**Sweet spot:** Seed rounds with $500K - $1M initial investment.

### Valuation Guidelines

| Stage | Preferred Valuation | Max Valuation |
|-------|---------------------|---------------|
| Pre-seed | <$10M | $15M |
| Seed | <$30M | $50M |
| Series A | <$60M | $100M |

Higher valuations require exceptional team or data.

### Geographic Preferences

| Region | Priority |
|--------|----------|
| SF Bay Area | Highest |
| Boston/Cambridge | High |
| Other US | Medium |
| UK/EU | Medium |
| Asia | Lower |
| Remote | Case-by-case |

Co-location with LVV team enables better support.

## Therapeutic Focus Areas

### High Priority (Hallmarks of Aging)

1. **Cellular Senescence**
   - Senolytics (clearing senescent cells)
   - Senomorphics (modulating SASP)
   - Detection and monitoring

2. **Epigenetic Reprogramming**
   - Partial reprogramming (Yamanaka factors)
   - Epigenetic clocks and modification
   - Age reversal approaches

3. **Mitochondrial Dysfunction**
   - Mitochondrial replacement
   - NAD+ metabolism
   - Mitophagy enhancement

4. **Proteostasis**
   - Autophagy activation
   - Chaperone therapy
   - Aggregate clearance

5. **Stem Cell Exhaustion**
   - Stem cell rejuvenation
   - Niche modulation
   - Regenerative approaches

### Medium Priority

- Inflammaging / chronic inflammation
- Nutrient sensing pathways (mTOR, AMPK, sirtuins)
- Telomere biology
- Microbiome and dysbiosis
- Immune aging

### Lower Priority (But Considered)

- Single-indication age-related diseases without aging mechanism focus
- Diagnostics (unless linked to intervention)
- Digital health / longevity lifestyle

---

## Team Criteria

### Ideal Founder Profile

- **Scientific expertise:** PhD or MD with aging biology background
- **Startup experience:** Prior founding experience or senior role at startup
- **Domain network:** Connections to key labs, advisors, potential hires
- **Fundraising ability:** Can articulate vision and attract capital

### Red Flags

- No scientific founder on team
- First-time founders without advisors
- Team entirely academic (no business experience)
- Founder conflicts or unclear equity splits

### Positive Signals

- Calico, Altos Labs, Unity Biotechnology alumni
- Published aging researchers (Sinclair lab, Bhardwaj lab, etc.)
- Prior successful exit in biotech
- Strong scientific advisory board

---

## Deal Structure Preferences

### Equity

- Target ownership: 5-10% at entry
- Pro-rata rights for follow-on
- Board seat or observer for larger investments

### Preferred Terms

- Standard NVCA documents
- 1x non-participating preferred
- Standard protective provisions
- Reasonable anti-dilution

### Concerns

- Full-ratchet anti-dilution
- Excessive liquidation preferences
- Heavy founder vesting already completed
- Complex cap tables with many small investors

---

## Due Diligence Focus

### Scientific DD

1. Review published data and manuscripts
2. Expert calls with domain scientists
3. IP landscape analysis
4. Reproducibility of key findings

### Commercial DD

1. Market size and competitive landscape
2. Regulatory pathway assessment
3. Clinical development plan
4. Manufacturing considerations

### Team DD

1. Reference checks (360-degree)
2. Prior work verification
3. Founder dynamics assessment
4. Hiring plan and key roles

---

## Co-Investment Preferences

### Preferred Syndicate Partners

Investors with aging/longevity focus:
- Korify Capital
- Longevity Vision Fund
- Apollo Health Ventures
- Lifespan.io
- Other specialized funds

General biotech with aging interest:
- a16z Bio
- Khosla Ventures
- DCVC
- 8VC

### Syndication Strategy

- LVV can lead or co-lead seed rounds
- Prefers to invest alongside deep domain investors
- Will follow established leads at Series A
- Values investor expertise over just capital
