### No Geroscience Fit

**Use when:** Company targets disease indication without aging biology mechanism.

```
Hi [NAME],

Thank you for reaching out and sharing what you're building at [COMPANY].
[BRIEF ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THEIR WORK - e.g., "The approach to X is interesting."]

After reviewing, we don't think this is the right fit for Lifespan Vision Ventures.
Our fund focuses specifically on therapeutics targeting the underlying biology of
aging—cellular senescence, epigenetic reprogramming, mitochondrial dysfunction,
and similar hallmarks. While [THEIR FOCUS] certainly impacts healthspan, we
concentrate on companies where aging biology is the primary mechanism of action
rather than the downstream benefit.

Best of luck with the raise and [CONFERENCE].

[YOUR NAME]

### Wrong Stage (Too Early)

**Use when:** Pre-seed with no data, first-time founders without advisors.

```
Hi [NAME],

Thank you for sharing [COMPANY]'s vision with us. The concept of [BRIEF DESCRIPTION]
is compelling.

At this stage, we typically look for companies with at least preliminary proof-of-concept
data (in vitro or early in vivo) that validates the core mechanism. As you generate
initial data and build out your scientific advisory network, we'd be happy to reconnect.

Please keep us in mind for your seed round once you have POC results.

Best,
[YOUR NAME]
```

### Wrong Stage (Too Late)

**Use when:** Series B+, crossover rounds, or pre-IPO.

```
Hi [NAME],

Thank you for the introduction to [COMPANY]. The progress you've made is impressive,
and [SPECIFIC MILESTONE] is a significant achievement.

Lifespan Vision Ventures focuses on pre-seed through Series A investments. Given
[COMPANY]'s current stage and round size, we're not the right fit as a lead or
significant participant. However, we'd be happy to make introductions to later-stage
investors in our network who focus on [RELEVANT AREA].

Wishing you continued success.

Best,
[YOUR NAME]
```

---

### Medical Device (Not Therapeutic)

**Use when:** Company is building devices, diagnostics, or non-therapeutic products.

```
Hi [NAME],

Thank you for reaching out about [COMPANY]. The clinical results you've achieved
with [PRODUCT] are encouraging.

Lifespan Vision Ventures focuses exclusively on therapeutic interventions—small
molecules, biologics, cell therapies, and gene therapies that target aging biology.
We don't currently invest in medical devices or diagnostics, even when they address
age-related conditions.

I'd recommend reaching out to device-focused funds like [SUGGEST IF KNOWN] who
may be a better fit.

Best of luck,
[YOUR NAME]
```

---

### Valuation Concern

**Use when:** Valuation exceeds LVV parameters or terms are unfavorable.

```
Hi [NAME],

Thank you for sharing [COMPANY]'s opportunity. The science is compelling, and
your team has made meaningful progress.

After reviewing the current terms, we've concluded that the valuation is above
our typical investment parameters for this stage. We generally target [STAGE]
investments at valuations below [THRESHOLD].

If your round structure evolves or you're planning a future round at different
terms, we'd welcome the opportunity to reconnect.

Best,
[YOUR NAME]
```

---

### Geographic Mismatch

**Use when:** Company is in restricted geography or lacks US/EU presence.

```
Hi [NAME],

Thank you for introducing [COMPANY]. The work you're doing on [FOCUS AREA]
is interesting.

Lifespan Vision Ventures primarily invests in US and EU-based companies where
we can provide hands-on support and leverage our network effectively. Given
[COMPANY]'s current geographic focus, we don't think we'd be able to add the
value you deserve as investors.

We'd recommend connecting with regional investors who specialize in [GEOGRAPHY]
biotech.

Best of luck with the raise,
[YOUR NAME]
```

## Usage Notes

1. **Personalize the bracketed sections** - Generic declines feel dismissive
2. **Acknowledge something specific** - Shows you actually reviewed their materials
3. **Be direct but kind** - Don't leave false hope
4. **Offer alternatives when possible** - Referrals, future reconnection, other investors
5. **Keep it brief** - 3-4 short paragraphs maximum

## Quick Decline (Ultra-Short)

For high-volume situations or clear mismatches:

```
Hi [NAME],

Thank you for reaching out. After review, [COMPANY] isn't a fit for our
current investment thesis focused on aging biology therapeutics. We wish
you the best with your fundraise.

Best,
[YOUR NAME]
```
